# minioclient 0.0.6

* bug-fix: more robust parsing of mc commands e.g. with spaces. ([#7])
* bug-fix: vectorize paths ([#8], [#9])

# minioclient 0.0.5

CRAN-policy based bugfix release. 

* bug-fix: 0.0.4 release introduced unit tests that wrote to `~/.mc`.
  Configuration files are now placed in `minio_path()` directory,
  using OS-specific path from `tools::R_user_dir()`,
  or configured as `options("minioclient.dir")`
* bug-fix: 0.0.4 introduced unit tests that downloaded binary without prompt.
  `install_mc()` will now prompt before install in interactive mode and must
  be called explicitly in batch scripts.
* bug-fix: 0.0.4 some tests may not have fail gracefully when depending on
  external resources.  This is now patched.

* Refactored function `mc_ls()` to provide results as a data.frame
* `mc_sql()` function added, which can query CSV, JSON and parquet objects using sql (S3 Select API sql syntax)
* `mc_head()` function added, which reads the first n lines from an object and returns a string
* `mc_cat()` function added, which can be useful when reading or previewing a smaller file directly from the object storage server without first requiring to download it locally

# minioclient 0.0.3

* New function, `mc_config_set()`, can be used to set session tokens [#1](https://github.com/cboettig/minioclient/issues/1).
